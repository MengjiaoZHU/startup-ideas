* To help students develop the ability to imagine and recognize startup ideas
* To teach students how to critique and improve ideas
* To broaden studentsâ€™ awareness of startup opportunities
* To give students experience collaborating with many of their peers
* To encourage students to pursue ambitious startup opportunities
