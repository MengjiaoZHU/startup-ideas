# Startup Ideas (CS 5092)

This studio-based course helps students develop their ability to imagine, recognize, develop, and improve startup ideas. 

In each class, students learn a different approach to product ideation or product critique, then practice that approach, working in many different teams and environments. Students invent and explore thousands of startup ideas, share their ideas with each other using Unicornucopia, and help each other evaluate and improve those ideas.

By the end of the course, students self-organize into co-founding teams around specific startup ideas that they will execute on in Startup Studio the following semester.

The objectives of the course are:

* To help students develop the ability to imagine and recognize startup ideas
* To teach students how to critique and improve ideas
* To broaden studentsâ€™ awareness of startup opportunities
* To give students experience collaborating with many of their peers
* To help students choose co-founders and a startup idea for Startup Studio
* To encourage students to pursue ambitious startup opportunities

Student responsibilities:

* As a studio-based course, attendance and participation are critical for learning
* Students must read the readings for a given week *before* that class
* Students must actively use Unicornucopia

Grading:

* In order to earn an A, each student must add at least 23 startup ideas or Wings to Unicornucopia, and constructively comment upon at least 69 startup ideas of other students in Unicornucopia.
